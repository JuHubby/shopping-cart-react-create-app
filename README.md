# Shopping Cart

## Description of the project:
 This is a standalone React application showcasing a shopping cart template for a website. Users can view restocked products using Strapi tools and interact by adding products to the cart, dynamically updating the checkout total. The cart includes the option to remove products. Additionally, there's a feature where the product pictures update every time you reload the page from [picsum](https://picsum.photos/). I encourage you to explore this fantastic source for random pictures. Requests are made through the URL, allowing you to specify characteristics such as color and size for your pictures. You can learn more about this functionality on Picsum's website.

## How to Run:

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

##### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

##### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

##### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Roadmap of future improvements:
Several improvements are needed for this application. Starting with the restocking process, I aim to find a method to add products to the list without repetition, incrementing existing quantities or adding new products if necessary. Additionally, I intend to enhance the aesthetic appeal of the page to make it more attractive to clients/users. Furthermore, I plan to implement functionality where adding a product to the cart decreases its stock count, and once stock runs out, the add button is disabled.
